# Hospital System Ontology – Protégé Project 🏥

This project models a hospital information system using ontology concepts in Protégé. It defines entities such as patients, doctors, treatments, diagnoses, and their relationships.

## 📄 Files

- `Hospitalsystem.rdf` – Main ontology (classes, properties, axioms)
- `HospitalIndividuals.json` – Instance data for patients, doctors, and treatments

## 🔍 Key Features

- Classes: Patient, Doctor, Ward, Diagnosis, Treatment, Appointment
- Object Properties: assignedTo, admittedTo, diagnosedWith, undergoesTreatment
- Data Properties: hasName, hasAge, hasID, hasPhoneNumber
- Individuals: John Doe, Jane Doe, Alex Khan (example patients)

## 🚀 How to View the Ontology

3. Navigate through:
   - **Classes** tab for entity definitions
   - **Individuals** tab for instance data (can import JSON using plugins)
   - **DL Query** for reasoning and querying relationships
